/* Matrix journey chapter 9 (new 2026-09-20): The Matrix Reloaded (2003), the restaurant.
   Sits between the subway (n:8) and the Architect (n:10). Every branch ends with the crew getting the Keymaker,
   because the Architect chapter needs him.
   Kept clean: Persephone's price is a kiss and one dry line about it, nothing more.
   New art used here: cast merovingian "stand" (dinner jacket, wine glass, a smile that is doing work) and
   persephone "stand" (white dress, entirely unimpressed). Set "restaurant" already exists. */
