/* Matrix journey chapter 4: The Matrix, "The Agents have Morpheus". Content only (Opus pass).
   Canon: Cypher's betrayal kills Mouse (in the Matrix), Apoc and Switch (unplugged) and Dozer; Tank survives and kills
   Cypher. Morpheus fights Smith so the others can escape and is taken to a government building to be broken for the
   Zion mainframe codes. Tank is about to pull his plug when Neo decides to go in. Every choice here still ends with Neo
   inside the Matrix and cornered by Smith at a subway station in ch05.
   New art used here: set "lobby" (a marble government lobby with columns, a revolving door); cast morpheus: "chair"
   (strapped into a chair, wired up), "stand"; neo: "coat" (long black coat, sunglasses); trinity: "coat";
   smith: "stand"; fx "plug" (the jack cable at the back of a head, a hand on it), "shells" (spent casings on marble,
   no weapons drawn). Deaths handled plainly. */
