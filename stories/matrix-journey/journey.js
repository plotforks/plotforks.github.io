/* The Matrix trilogy journey: meta, scores and early exits. Design: MATRIX-PLAN.md. Content only (Opus pass).
   Chapters live in ch01.js ... ch08.js plus the aftertaste ch09.js and push onto .chapters; finale endings live in endings.js.
   The meter is the belief score (not darkness): `meterScore` names it, `meterLabel` is its display name.
   In share lines, {meter} is replaced by the final belief score. */
