/* Matrix journey chapter 3: The Matrix, "The Oracle". Content only (Opus pass).
   Canon: she never says the words outright; she reads his palms and eyes, says he has the gift but seems to be waiting for
   something, and lets him conclude he is not the One. She also warns that Morpheus will give his life for him.
   Nobody (Neo, Morpheus) knows yet that she is a program; that is revealed in Reloaded.
   New art used here: set "kitchen" (a small apartment kitchen, an oven, a "know thyself" sign over the door, a vase on a
   stand); cast oracle: "stand", "cookie" (holding out a cookie); neo: "sit"; fx "vase" (a vase falling and breaking),
   "cookies" (a tray of cookies); set "street" (a rainy city street at night, a parked car, lit windows). */
