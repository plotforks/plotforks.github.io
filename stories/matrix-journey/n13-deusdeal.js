/* Matrix journey chapter 13 (new 2026-09-20): The Matrix Revolutions (2003), the terms.
   Plays only when Neo actually reaches the Machine City (chapter-level when: "machineCity"), which is
   n:12 choices a and c; the defendZion branch skips straight to the last fight (n:14).
   Every branch ends with Neo plugged in against Smith, so the last fight keeps its premise.
   No new art: set "machinecity", cast deus "face" and neo "stand" all exist. */
