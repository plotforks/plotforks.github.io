/* Matrix journey chapter 7: The Matrix Revolutions (2003), "Machine City or Zion". Content only (Opus pass).
   Canon: Neo, freed from the Mobil Ave station, takes Niobe's ship to the Machine City with Trinity; Bane (Smith in a human
   body) stows away and blinds him; Neo sees in gold light; Trinity dies in the crash; Neo offers the Deus Ex Machina a deal
   (he stops Smith, they spare Zion). Every branch ends with the machines willing to plug Neo in against Smith, so ch08 holds.
   "manager" (ch06 c) pays off here. Trinity's death handled plainly.
   New art used here: sets "dock" (Zion's dock: a huge domed cavern, gun turrets, a drilling hole in the ceiling),
   "machinecity" (black towers, lightning, a golden sky above the clouds); cast neo: "blind" (a cloth over his eyes);
   niobe: "stand"; deus: "face" (a giant face made of a swarm of small machines);
   fx "gold" (Neo's gold-light vision), "crash" (a ship nose-down among towers, no bodies shown), "emp" (a blue pulse ring). */
