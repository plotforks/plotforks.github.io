/* Matrix journey chapter 6: The Matrix Reloaded (2003), "The Architect". Content only (Opus pass).
   Canon: Neo is told he is the sixth One and that the prophecy is a control system. The door to the right leads to the
   Source (reload the Matrix, pick 23 people to rebuild Zion); the door to the left leads back to the Matrix to save
   Trinity, who is falling with a bullet in her, at the risk of human extinction. Neo takes the left door, restarts her
   heart, then stops Sentinels in the real world and falls into a coma. Every branch ends with that coma, so ch07 holds.
   Trinity's death in choice b is handled plainly.
   New art used here: set "architect" (a white room walled with TV screens, two glowing doors); cast architect: "sit"
   (white suit, white beard, pen); neo: "fly"; trinity: "fall"; fx "screens" (many small TV screens, each showing Neo),
   "sentinels" (squid-like machines in the dark, sparks as they drop). */
