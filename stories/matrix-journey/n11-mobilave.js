/* Matrix journey chapter 11 (new 2026-09-20): The Matrix Revolutions (2003), Mobil Ave.
   Sits between the Architect (n:10) and the Machine City decision (n:12): this is the coma, from the inside.
   Every branch ends with Neo back on the ship, so nothing downstream changes premise.
   New art used here: cast trainman "stand" (overalls, a lantern, too many keys on his belt).
   Set "subway", cast sati "stand", neo "stand" / "sit" and fx "train" already exist. */
