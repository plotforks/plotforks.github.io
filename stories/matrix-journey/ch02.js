/* Matrix journey chapter 2: The Matrix, "Cypher's drink". Content only (Opus pass).
   Canon order: Cypher offers Neo the drink on the ship before the Oracle visit, and his steak dinner with Smith follows the
   same night, so this chapter comes before the Oracle (the approved list had them the other way round).
   Cypher's betrayal happens in every non-exit branch; the "warned" flag only changes how much damage he does in ch04.
   New art used here: sets "ship" (the Nebuchadnezzar's main deck: worn chairs with head jacks, screens of falling green code),
   "restaurant" (a white-tablecloth table, a steak, a wine glass); cast cypher: "drink", "stand"; smith: "stand";
   tank: "stand"; fx "code" (falling green code on the screens), "steak". */
