/* Matrix journey chapter 9 (aftertaste): the end of Revolutions, "The park at sunrise". Content only (Opus pass).
   Canon: Sati paints a sunrise for Neo; the Architect meets the Oracle in the park, confirms the peace and that those who
   want out will be freed; asked how long it will last, she says as long as it can; Sati asks if they will see Neo again
   and the Oracle suspects so. Choice b points at The Matrix Resurrections (2021): the Analyst revives Neo and Trinity,
   Thomas Anderson is a game designer whose company demands a sequel, and the cafe is called Simulatte. Paraphrased only.
   Every choice sets one of peaceHold / sequel / wakeAll.
   New art used here: set "park" (a playground and benches at sunrise, a rainbow of code in the sky); cast oracle: "sit";
   architect: "stand"; sati: "stand" (a little girl); neo: "bench" (sitting, a cloth over his eyes); analyst: "stand"
   (a smiling man in a sweater, glasses); set "cafe" (a coffee shop counter, two tables); trinity: "cafe" (older, at a
   table); fx "sunrise" (shared with Breaking Bad ch11a), "gruel" (a bowl of grey porridge), "vase" (shared with ch03). */
