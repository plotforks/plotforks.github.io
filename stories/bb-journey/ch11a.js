/* Journey chapter 11a (aftertaste, shootout runs only): S5E16 "Felina". Content only (Opus pass).
   Plays only when ch10 ended in the shootout; ch11b covers surrender and deal runs. Every choice sets one of
   gunTrunk / jackDeal / jesseKeys. Beats are shown after the choice's effects apply, so beat `when` uses the new scores.
   Canon note: in the aired episode Jack only brings up the money after the gun has fired, and Walt shoots him
   before he finishes the sentence. Here Jack gets to make the offer first; choice a keeps the aired order.
   Violence handled plainly, never as a joke.
   New art used here: set "compound" (Jack's clubhouse: pool table, bar, a window onto parked cars);
   walt "keys" (holding a car key fob, thumb on the button), walt "floor" (lying on the floor, hand over Jesse);
   jesse "chained" (in chains, beard, prison-shop overalls), jesse "drive" (at the wheel of a car);
   cast todd: "stand"; fx "flash" (a white flash in the window, no visible gun or bodies), fx "sunrise" (low sun on the horizon). */
