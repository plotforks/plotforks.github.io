/* Journey chapter 12: S5E7 "Say My Name". Content only (Opus pass). The second Mike chapter.
   Plays after Buyout (n:12) and before the nine men in prison (n:14). Sets mikeLives / mikeDead, used by the endings.
   The killing is stated plainly in one line and never drawn or joked about.
   New art used here: cast mike "sit" (on a bench, forearms on knees, coffee). Set park already exists. */
