/* Journey chapter 14: after S5E8 "Gliding Over All". Content only (Opus pass).
   Dimos's premise: a rational businessman with this much money would not leave it in a barrel.
   Plays after the cash pile (n:15) and before Hank's bathroom (n:17). Sets portfolio / chainTycoon / barrel.
   Never instructional: no real vehicles, structures or jurisdictions are described, and Skyler's
   spreadsheet does all the actual work, as usual.
   New art used here: fx "chart" (a rising line chart drawn on a wall or a screen). Sets office, storage,
   chainmap and cast skyler "spreadsheet" / "ceo" all exist. */
