/* Journey chapter 17: S5E13/14, the minute between To'hajiilee and Ozymandias. Content only (Opus pass).
   Dimos's premise: Jack's crew take cover behind the cars and nobody fires at all.
   Plays only on shootout runs (chapter-level when). Decides whether a shot is ever fired:
     a -> noShots + hankLives            (Walt is arrested; the run finishes at the sentencing chapter, n:23b)
     b -> shotsFired + atLarge  (canon)  (the run continues to ch17-jack.js, n:21, then Felina, n:23a)
     c -> noShots + hankLives + hostages + atLarge  (no shot fired, but Walt stays free; finishes at Felina)
   `atLarge` is the flag the two aftertaste chapters switch on, so it must be set by every branch that leaves
   Walt free. No gun is ever drawn, described or shown.
   New art used here: fx "dust" (a dust cloud from cars that have just stopped hard). Set desert, cast jack "stand",
   walt "kneel", hank "cuffed" (added for ch17-jack.js) all exist or are already on the art list. */
