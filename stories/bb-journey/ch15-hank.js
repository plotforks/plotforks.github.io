/* Journey chapter 15: S5E8 "Gliding Over All", the last ninety seconds. Content only (Opus pass).
   Dimos's premise: Hank decides whether to read books in the toilet. The only chapter played as Hank.
   Continuity rule: Hank still closes in on Walt in every branch, so n:19 (To'hajiilee) keeps its premise;
   only the route and the timing change. Sets bookFound / bookMissed / bookLab.
   No new art: set bathroom and cast hank "read" / "suspicious" / "laugh" all exist. */
