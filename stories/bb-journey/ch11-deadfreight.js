/* Journey chapter 11: S5E5 "Dead Freight". Content only (Opus pass). The train heist and the boy on the ridge.
   Plays after End Times (n:10) and before Buyout (n:12), so the methylamine is already in the ground when
   Declan makes his offer. Sets drewDead / boySafe, used by the endings and by the Ozymandias chapter (n:22).
   No new art: set desert, fx "train", cast walt "stand"/"point"/"kneel", jesse "stand", todd "stand", mike "stand" all exist.
   The killing is stated once, plainly, and is never drawn or joked about. */
